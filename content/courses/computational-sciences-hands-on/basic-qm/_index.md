# Page summary for search engines.
summary: One-dimensional systems are the staple of beginning quantum mechanics courses. Various analytic and approximate techniques are utilized to study such systems. Numerics gives a unique opportunity to solve all 1D systems to arbitrary required precision. How do we do this? Can we understand both the spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenstates and the dynamics using numerical methods? What can 1D systems tell us about numerical methods in general?

Systems in one-dimension provide a perfect test bed for understanding the weird aspects of quantum mechanics. In this module, we leverage numerical approaches to obtain exact solutions for arbitrary 1D systems and try to understand them. In the process, we will encounter for the first time an array of core concepts common to all numerical studies --- What does convergence mean? What is a basis set? Does the choice of basis set matter in one-dimension? How do we simulate dynamics?
