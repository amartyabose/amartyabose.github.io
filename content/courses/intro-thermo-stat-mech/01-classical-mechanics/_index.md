Classical mechanics forms the foundational laws which describe the evolution of
systems in time. First developed by [Isaac
Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) in the late 1600s in his
[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi√¶_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica)
or the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, these laws have since
become the corner stone of all of science. Subsequent reformulations by
[Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange) and
[William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton)
gave more elegant and novel geometric interpretations. These later developments
provide essential building blocks for statistical mechanics.

In this module, we briefly touch upon these formulations.
