While classical mechanics provides a complete description of the dynamics of a
system, the concepts of equilibria require other ideas to be developed.
Thermodynamics is the field that describes the macroscopic quantities required
for characterizing bulk systems. Traditionally, the so-called laws of
thermodynamics prove to be the fundamentals. These laws have been developed over
centuries and often have different statements of the same law.

We follow a postulates-based approach to thermodynamics developed in by Herbert Callen.
