## Goals of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

How do we describe large systems? How do we understand properties of systems
with complex interactions? What is equilibrium and what is *not* equilibrium?
What constitutes a phase transition and how is it characterized?

Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics seeks to answer these and many other
questions about emergent properties of bulk systems.
