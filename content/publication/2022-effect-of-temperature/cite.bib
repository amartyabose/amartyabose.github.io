  abstract  = {The recently introduced multisite tensor network path integral (MS-TNPI) method [Bose and Walters{,} J. Chem. Phys.{,} 2022{,} 156{,} 24101] for simulating quantum dynamics of extended systems has been shown to be effective in studying one-dimensional systems coupled with local baths. Quantum transport in these systems is typically studied at a constant temperature. However{,} temperature seems to be a very obvious parameter that can be spatially changed to control this transport. Here{,} MS-TNPI is used to study the “non-equilibrium” effects of an externally imposed temperature profile on the excitonic transport in one-dimensional Frenkel chains coupled with local vibrations. We show that in addition to being important for incorporating heating effects of excitation by lasers{,} temperature can also be an interesting parameter for quantum control.}
